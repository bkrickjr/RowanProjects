HOW TO USE THIS PROJECT: The Driver Class has a hard coded library of 6 items already stored in it as an example, creating the items requires 
a string title, boolean availability, integers of how many hours and how many minutes, and another integer of the copyrite year.
CDs, have the additional fields of a string artist, and integer of number of tracks. DVDs do not have any of CD's fields but a string of it's rating
(G, PG, PG13, R, and NC17), and integers of hours and minutes of bonus footage. The Audio book has its own exclusive fields of a string for the author,
and a string for the Narrator too.
