AUTHOR: Brian Krick
DATE: 9/9
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Create a family class by entering it's own unique ID number, then continue to input the family's last name,
street address, city, state and zip in string form. To add members to the family you must first create a member using the Member
class by entering their ID and an integer, and strings for their first name and gender using M F or T. Once created, you can use
the addMember method from the family class to put the desired member into the family of your choosing. You can also search through
families by using the showMember methods, the closed parenthesis will show all the members while the method that requires a 
string will allow you to only show members of a gender of your choosing (M F or T). The ShowAll method shows all the information
about the family including their full address, ID numbers names, and genders.
