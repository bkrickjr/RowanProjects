PROJECT TITLE:CH10 HW 
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: This project allows us to creat shapes, circles, rectangles, and squares, and from 
all classes except Shape, we can find the area and perimeter of these objects
DATE: 10/17
AUTHOR: Brian Krick
USER INSTRUCTIONS: The test classes will work as good drivers, however if you want to experiment for 
yourself, you can create any of the shapes in several ways! the defaults will set the color to green and
filled to false, one objects other than Shape you can pass it 1 double (2 for rectangles) and it will set the radius or side length (width then length for rectangles), or you can pass the color filled and one double (two still for rectangles) to completely customize your shape!
