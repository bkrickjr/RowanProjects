PROJECT TITLE:CH10 HW copy copy
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: This version of the project was to show what would happen if you made Shape an interface. This requires us to duplicate a lot of code in the color and filled variables and their getter/setters but allows us to easily use that pesky getArea() method
DATE: 10/17
AUTHOR: Brian Krick
USER INSTRUCTIONS: This project works the same as the original now, however you can no longer create Shape objects because it is now an interface. This Version of the project also has the Last two methods asked for at the end of the spec
