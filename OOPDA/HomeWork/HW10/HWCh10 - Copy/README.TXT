PROJECT TITLE:CH10 HW copy
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: This version of the project was to show what would happen if you took the getArea()
method and made it abstract. In order to compile, you would have to make Shape an abstract class
DATE: 10/17
AUTHOR: Brian Krick
USER INSTRUCTIONS: The Shape class in this version is broken because we made getArea abstract but all
other classes still work the same.
