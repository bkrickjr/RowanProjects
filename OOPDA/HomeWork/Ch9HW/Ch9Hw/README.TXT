Author: Brian Krick 
DATE:9/30
USER INSTRUCTIONS:This project allows you to create organizations and assign employees to them either as programmers or testers. All Employees require a string Name, string Sex (M F or T), Organization link, and a string birthday in the form of "XX/XX/XX" . The Programmers have a specified preferred language and the testers have a link to the programmer they are supposed to be testing for. The Organization can be created at any time and add as many employees as desired. Employees cannot be created without an organization first. The testers cannot be created unless there is a programmer to assign them to, multiple testers can test the same programmer however.
