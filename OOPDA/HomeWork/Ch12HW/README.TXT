USER INSTRUCTIONS: The top button simply searches for the letter A in a file, after pressing the button a window pops up and asks for the name of the file you wish to look through, enter the name and as long as the file exists the number will show up on the screen. The String Search box can be modified to whatever word you want to look for in a text file, once you have entered the word you want, hit the search button and it will ask for the name of the file, enter that and the results will be displayed on screen for you. The find line button, once pressed, also asks you for the name of the file you wish to search through, as long as there is a number at the begining of the file, the contents of that line will be written to the screen for you.
